Description: Utilizes metaheuristic algorithms to simultaneously find the best-
    fitting model for various factor structures and select which factor 
    structure has the highest fit. Currently, simulated annealing is the only 
    metaheuristic algorithm in use, but ant colony optimization may be 
    incorporated in the future.
